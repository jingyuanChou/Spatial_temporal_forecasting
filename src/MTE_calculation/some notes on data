Data is 51 states from July of 2020 to end of March of 2022, total 91 weeks

so basically, for Multivariate TE calculation, we need to obtain the MTE for every timestamp, for example 

choose 24 as starting point and set 12 as lag

so we calculate MTE for 

51 * (0-24), and next timestamp, we have 51 * (0-25), until we reach the end, the maximum input for the MultivariateTE is 51 * 91, the whole dataset
